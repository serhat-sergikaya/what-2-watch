# About the project

 
 **What 2 Watch** is a website that allows users to search for movies and series using sorting paramaters.
 The website is connected to [The Movie Database API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). TMDB provides data for movies and series including their details such as cast members, production companies etc.
 It also allows to add query parameters to narrow down the search.
 React Query is used for API calls, Zustand for Global State Management and React Router for navigation.
